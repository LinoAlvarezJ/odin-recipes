# odin-recipes
odin-recpies is a basic recipe website that consists of a main index page that contains links to a few recipes. For now the project will consist of only HTML and will test foundational skills of HTML acquired so far, such as: git basics, elements and tags, HTML boilerplate, working with text, list, links and images, and commit messages.
