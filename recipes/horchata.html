        <h2><em>A refreshing beverage to cool off in the summertime!</em></h2>
        <p>Horchata is a refreshing summer drink. I learned this recipe a couple years ago from a Mexican coworker, and I was immediately addicted!</p>
        
        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 quarts hot water</li>
          <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
          <li>1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
          <li>1 cup long grain rice</li>  
          <li>1 cup milk</li>
          <li>ice cubes, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Direction</strong></h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Pour sugar, cinnamon, and rice into hot water; stir until sugar dissolves. Cover, and let stand at room temperature for at least 3 hours, but preferably overnight.</li>
          <li>Stir in milk, then puree with a hand blender, or in batches in a standing blender until the rice resembles fine sand. Strain through several layers of cheesecloth, or through a very fine strainer. Serve over ice.</li>
        </ol>
